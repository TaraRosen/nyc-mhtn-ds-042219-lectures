    "#### Using Mutual Information Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate Mutual Information Scores, we'll need to first create a frequency filter, so that we only examine bigrams that occur more than a set number of times--for our purposes, we'll set this limit to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "In NLTK, mutual information is often referred to as `pmi`, for **_Pointwise Mutual Information_**. Calculating PMI scores works much the same way that we created bigrams, with a few notable differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll start by creating another finder for pmi. Create another `BigramCollocationFinder.from_words` and pass in `flat_satire` as the input. Store this is the variable `satire_pmi_finder`.\n",
    "* Once we have our finder, we'll need to apply our frequency filter. Call `satire_pmi_finder`'s `apply_freq_filter` and pass in the number `5` as the input. \n",
    "* Now, we can use the finder to calculate pmi scores. Use the pmi finder's `.score_ngrams()` function, and pass in `bigram_measures.pmi` as the argument. Store this in `satire_pmi_scored`.\n",
    "* Examine the first 50 elements in `satire_pmi_scored`.\n",
    "* Do the same for `flat_not_satire`"
